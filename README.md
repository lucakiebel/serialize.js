**[INSTALL][i] | [USAGE][u] | [AUTHOR][auth] | [LICENSE][cpl]**

This is a modification of the Google Project [form-serialize](https://code.google.com/archive/p/form-serialize/). Click the link to find the original piece of software. 

```
window.location.href = "https://example.com/?"+serialize(document.forms[0]);
```

## MOTIVATION
It's still very common not to include any heavy libraries into a JavaScript project. This tries to solve the problem of not being able to serialize forms in [browsers that don't support the FormData API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData#Browser_compatibility). 

### INSTALLATION
[i]: #installation 'Installation guide' 

Include the [minified script](https://rawgit.com/lucakiebel/serialize.js/s/serialize.min.js) in your HTML, this will expose the function `serialize()`:
```html
<script src="https://rawgit.com/lucakiebel/serialize.js/s/serialize.min.js"></script>
<form id="test">
  <input type="text" name="some" value="Random">
  <input type="text" name="field" value="Values"> 
  <input type="number" name="names" value="123565">
  <input type="password" name="andAPassword" value="andMore">
  <br><br>
  <button type="button" id="serialize">Serialize!</button>
</form>
<hr>
<p id="s">Result: </p>
<script>
document.getElementById("serialize").onclick = () => {
  document.getElementById("s").innerHTML += (serialize(document.forms[0])); 
}
</script>
```

### USAGE
[u]: #usage 'Product usage'

In most cases, forms need to be serialized to send their data to an API endpoint. Using the `fetch()` API, this is how you would go about accomplishing this:
```html
<script src="https://rawgit.com/lucakiebel/serialize.js/s/serialize.min.js"></script>
<form>
	<input type="text" name="ID">
	<input type="text" name="Name"> <br>
	<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<script> 
  document.forms[0].onsubmit = () => { 
    let url = "https://yourDomain.tld/end/point";
    let data = serialize(document.forms[0]); 
    fetch(url + "?" + data)
      .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(function(myJson) {
        console.log(myJson);
      });
    return false; 
  } 
</script>
```
